					<br>My name is Noah Slavik, welcome to my home page. I was born and raised in Saginaw and ventured to Ypsilanti to attend EMU before I joined Grand Circus. I am currently studying computer science with the intention to finish my degree as I delve into the software industry.<br><br>

						<li>Traveling. This has to be my number one sought after activity. Constantly I am planning my next big trip, that allows me to escape the harsh reality of Michigan. I had drove across the country on many different occasions, roadtripping through states such as Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Utah, and many more. I plan to take my trips international in the spring and summer of 2020 if Covid-19 permits !<br><br><br></li>
						<li> Hiking and Exploration of State/National Parks. This pairs extremely well with my first interest, as the reason I am traveling for the most part is to experience what natural wonders of the world I can. I am also and avid photographer of national landmarks and structures while hiking. I've asceneded Angels Landing, treking through the notrious Walter's Wiggles, to a breathtaking view of Zion National Park. This trail loops through a ridiculously narrow goat path with immense drop offs on either side of the trail. In addition, I have hiked to the top of Clouds Rest in Yosemite National Park. This near 15mi hike is a mainly rising incline trek that ends at a knife-like peak outlooking the valley. </li>
